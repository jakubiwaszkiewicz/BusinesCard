      <h4>About</h4>
      <p>
        Hey there! I'm a second-year architecture student, and my passion for
        becoming an architect is unwavering. I'm particularly drawn to the
        innovative world of bio-climatic houses and other architectural features
        that not only offer shelter but also elevate the quality of living. I'm
        dedicated to staying on top of the latest advancements and best
        practices in architectural design, always on the lookout for new things
        to learn. My dynamic approach to learning reflects a genuine enthusiasm
        for pushing the boundaries of traditional design, making me a promising
        and forward-thinking contributor to the exciting realm of architecture.
